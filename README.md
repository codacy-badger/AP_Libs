**AP_LIBS**

Some libraries for the _Advanced Programming_ exam in _Tongji University (Shanghai)_, but are good for every _Advanced Programming_ course or to know how to use some ADTs for personal interest.

There are:
- linked lists
- stacks
- queues
- hash tables
- sorting algorithms

Everything is tested and actually works.
Hope that the comments help you on understanding the code.
If you need to change the data type (obvioulsy if it is a number or char type) change the 'typedef int ADT_type' which is in the first lines of every .h file to 'typedef _value you want_ ADT_type'.
If it is a string you need to add the memory allocation for the strings.

All the libraries are released under GNU v3.0, so have fun.
